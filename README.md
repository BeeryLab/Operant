Scripts for scoring operant social behavior

Operant Social Timer:
These scripts allow the user to quantify social behavior in an operant apparatus by moving a rodent icon to mimic behavior witnessed in any-speed playback video. 
Variables in the script allow the user to set the test duration (30 minutes is the session default) and results are scaled.

There are two versions of this file depending on whether the social chamber is arranged on the right or the left side of the apparatus relative to the video position.
